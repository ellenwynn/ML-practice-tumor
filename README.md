# ML-practice-tumor
A continuation of one of my ML projects - trying to fiddle with layers to increase accuracy.

I originally started this project in February 2023 for my Deep Learning class, edited with Jupyter Notebooks and Google CoLab.

The dataset I used are images from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection and belongs to Navoneel Chakrabarty.
